# Vherelib

## Project Description

As in many other major cities, the use of bicycles is becoming increasingly popular. One significant factor that facilitates the use of bicycles is the wide availability of rental bikes within the city. The largest provider of rental bikes in our local area is the company [Vélib](https://www.velib-metropole.fr/service). Founded in 2007, Vélib is one of the pioneering companies specializing in bike rentals worldwide. To date, they operate a fleet of over 19,000 bicycles across 1,464 stations in Paris. What makes this project intriguing from a data science perspective, particularly for those interested in social dynamics, is that Vélib' collects data on bicycle usage and makes a portion of this data openly available through an API.

The goal of this project is to create a visualization illustrating how the bike stations fill and empty over time. Specifically, I aim to develop a map of Paris where all the bicycle stations are represented as icons. The size of each icon will be determined by the number of bicycles currently available at the station. By collecting data over time, we can create an animation that reveals how Vélib' users move around the city as time progresses.

## Implementation Details

I will update this section with implementation details as soon as development begins and the need for additional information arises.
